This document outlines how AI (ChatGPT) was used during the development of the **Enrollment Multi-Step Form** project.

## 1. Understanding Project Requirements
ChatGPT was used to:
- Break down the enrollment flow into logical steps (student info, academic details, address, review)
- Understand how to implement step-based navigation using the Next.js App Router
- Clarify validation requirements for each form step

Example Prompts:
- **Explain how to build a multi-step form using Next.js App Router**
- **What is the best way to prevent users from skipping steps in a form?**
  


## 2. Form Handling & Validation
ChatGPT assisted in:
- Integrating React Hook Form with Zod schemas
- Writing validation rules for inputs like PIN, mobile number, and required fields
- Understanding common form submission issues

Example Prompts:
- **How to use React Hook Form with Zod in Next.js**
- **Why does a form keep refocusing on the first invalid field?**

  

## 3. Debugging & Error Resolution
AI was used as a debugging assistant to:
- Fix navigation loops between steps
- Resolve useEffect dependency warnings
- Debug missing module and import path errors
- Understand why form submission was not moving to the next step

Example Prompts:
- **Why does my Next.js page keep redirecting back to the previous step?**
- **What causes useEffect dependency array changed size error?**
